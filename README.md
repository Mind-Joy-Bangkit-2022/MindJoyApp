### Background

Although depression is not related to age, treating mental health from an early age is
very important considering that it can affect children's behavior and psychology from
childhood to adulthood. 9.7%) compared to adults aged 26-49 years (6.9%) and aged 50 years
and over (3.4%). Everyone needs to have insight into mental health and how to prevent it,
especially at an age that is prone to having psychological disorders. One of the factors why
adolescents are at risk for psychological disorders is due to pressure to adjust to their peers,
difficulty finding identity and identity crisis, as well as wrong perceptions obtained from the
media they access.

### Android
